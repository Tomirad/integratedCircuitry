TODO IntegratedCircuitry:

- Only certain buildings can be built inside compact combinator
- Copy & paste with blueprint
- Placing ghost compact-combinator revives all ports immediately
- Removing ghost removes all ports



- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined







Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
