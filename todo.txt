TODO IntegratedCircuitry:

- easier exit in compact-combinator

- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined

- Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
- Virtual signals for status panel

FAQ:
- allow belts, chests, inserters: NO! Not gonna happen for copy/paste
