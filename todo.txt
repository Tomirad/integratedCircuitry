TODO IntegratedCircuitry:

- remove existing blueprint io ports if robot tries to build too much compact-combinator
- bigger steel chest for blueprint storage (65'536 slots?)
- allow other mods to place notes/text/hints

- make circuit-pole very low (not 2 tiles height)



- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined







Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
