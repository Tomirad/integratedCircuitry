TODO IntegratedCircuitry:

- kill a compact-combinator with a weapon
- Destruction of content (drop items on floor)
- easier exit in compact-combinator
- template chest gets deleted when combinator in 0/0 is removed


- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined

- Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
- Virtual signals for status panel

FAQ:
