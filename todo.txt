TODO IntegratedCircuitry:


- lamp panel: no collision box (CollisionMask)
- compact-combinator don't remove if player inside
- kill a compact-combinator with a weapon
- Duplication of content
- Destruction of content (drop items on floor)
- easier exit in compact-combinator
- player spawn on top of each other
- player stuck on connections inside compact-combinator surface -> wire_reach: 64
- different texture for circuit-pole
- template chest gets deleted when combinator in 0/0 is removed


- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined

- Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
- Virtual signals for status panel

FAQ:
- allow belts, chests, inserters: NO! Not gonna happen for copy/paste
