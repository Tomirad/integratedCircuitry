TODO IntegratedCircuitry:

- Copy & paste with blueprint
- Placing ghost compact-combinator revives all ports immediately (because ghosts-ports can be removed)
- Removing ghost removes all ports
- what happens if something is built on ghost of compact-combinator
- allow other mods to place notes/text/hints


- Less restrictions on which chunk to use with more pole length (place more poles)
- No concrete floor but land which can't be mined







Status panel should copy settings in blueprint
